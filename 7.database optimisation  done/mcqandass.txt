Indexing should not be used when :
Options
When the tables are small and write intensive 
When the tables are huge and read intensive
When the tables are huge and write intensive 
Correct Answer
Solution Description
Indexing small tables may not be optimal because it can take the query optimizer longer to traverse the index searching for data than to perform a simple table scan. Indexing should only be used if the data is huge and the application is read-intensive.If an application is write intensive indexing might lower the performance of write operations.
